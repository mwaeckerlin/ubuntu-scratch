# Features

Numbered register of every feature; a number is never reused. Every feature is covered by tests listed in [TESTS.md](TESTS.md); the guard `tests/docs-contract.sh` fails when a feature has no test.

- **F1 — Unprivileged users.** The run user `somebody` and the build user `coder` exist with their home directories; the image switches to `somebody`, so every derived image starts non-root. Both have the ids and the shell of `mwaeckerlin/scratch` (`somebody` 100:1000, `coder` 101:1001, `/usr/sbin/nologin`), so images of both families share volumes. The default user `ubuntu` of the Ubuntu image is removed.
- **F2 — Shared group.** The group `shared-access` with the fixed id 500 contains `somebody`, for data shared on volumes between containers.
- **F3 — Variables for derived images.** `RUN_USER`, `RUN_GROUP`, `RUN_HOME`, `BUILD_USER`, `BUILD_GROUP`, `BUILD_HOME`, `SHARED_GROUP_NAME`, `SHARED_GROUP_ID` name the users and groups; `PKG_INSTALL`, `PKG_REMOVE`, `PKG_SEARCH`, `PKG_CLEANUP1`, `PKG_CLEANUP2`, `ALLOW_USER`, `ALLOW_BUILD` are the commands a Dockerfile uses instead of hard coding them, with `apt` on Ubuntu, and each of the package commands works on Ubuntu.
- **F4 — Language.** `LANG` defaults to `en_US.UTF-8`; a derived image sets another one with the build argument `lang`.
- **F5 — Prompt.** `PS1` is a coloured prompt that shows the container name from `CONTAINERNAME`.
- **F6 — Headless.** The image contains no shell, no busybox and no scripting language, so an attacker who reaches code execution finds no tool to pivot with.
- **F7 — Published for amd64 and arm64.** Every push builds the image natively for both architectures and publishes it under one tag on Docker Hub, with the reusable workflow of `mwaeckerlin/scratch`.
